# Simple Password Generator using Python
Hey coders! This is a simple python code that uses two libraries "random" and "string"
<br>
We store our character set in a variable and using the random library we take random letters from the variable and then join it using the join function.
<br>
Then we finally print the generated password and there we gp, our strong password generator project is ready!
<br>
Try to understand the code and implement it by yourself.
<br>
Keep coding!
